# Supabase Files

This directory contains the files for the Supabase project. They are not directly used by the app, but are used to configure the Supabase instance. The directory structure represents where the files should be located/uploaded in the Supabase interface.

Whenever you make changes to these files, you should also make the same changes in the Supabase instance (and vice versa).
